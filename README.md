# Whatever_game 🚀
Silly and *incomplete* physics game written in March 2002.

My first (and only) time messing around with DirectX with VB back in 2002. I was just seeing how things worked with no serious plan. Inspired by 'Thrust' and 'Choplifter' you piloted a rocket🚀 while rescuing the scientists🧑‍🔬 with your tractor-beam and escorting them to safety, silly power-ups💊, etc.

I don't even have the software to compile this myself anymore, and I can't remember much more about it than that. All the files are here though. If you go to the trouble, don't expect too much from this!

BTW, back in 2002 a good friend asked me what the game would be called (I hadn't even started it and he was under the misunderstanding that it might actually be good and might one day be a real game) and I replied "whatever", which stuck.
