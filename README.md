# Whatever_game 🚀
Silly and *incomplete* physics game written in March 2002.

My first (and only) time messing around with DirectX with VB back in 2002. I was just seeing how things worked with no serious plan. Inspired by 'Thrust' and 'Choplifter' you piloted a rocket🚀 while rescuing the scientists🧑‍🔬 with your tractor-beam and escorting them to safety, silly power-ups💊, etc.

I don't even have the software to compile this myself anymore, and I can't remember much more than that. All the files are here though. Seriously though, don't expect too much from this!
