# Whatever_game
Silly and Incomplete physics game written in March 2002.

My first (and only) time messing around with DirectX with VB back in 2002. I was just seeing how things worked with no serious plan. Inspired by 'Thrust' and 'Choplifter' you piloted a rocket while rescuing the scientists with your tractor-beam and escorting them to safety, silly power-ups, etc.

Seriously, don't expect much!
